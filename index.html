    <h1>What is React?</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Facebook and an open-source
        developer community run
        it. Although React is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development. The library first
        appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries for web development.</p>

    <h1>Spa and Mpa?</h1>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">Single Page Application?</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 50px;">A single-page application is an app that works inside a browser and does not require
        page reloading during use. You are using this type of applications every day. These are, for instance: Gmail,
        Google Maps, Facebook or GitHub.
        SPAs are all about serving an outstanding UX by trying to imitate a “natural” environment in the browser — no
        page reloads, no extra wait time. It is just one web page that you visit which then loads all other content
        using JavaScript — which they heavily depend on.

        SPA requests the markup and data independently and renders pages straight in the browser. We can do this thanks
        to the advanced JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS, Ember.js, Meteor.js, Knockout.js .
        Single-page sites help keep the user in one, comfortable web space where content is presented to the user in a
        simple, easy and workable fashion.</p>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">Multiple Page Application?</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 50px;">A multi-page app (MPA) basically means a traditional web application that loads on the
        server’s side. Each time a
        user refreshes a page or navigates from one page to another, the browser requests data from the server. As the
        name suggests, MPAs have multiple pages that function separately at all levels: in development, in the eyes of
        real users, and from the perspective of search engines. Most modern MPAs are developed with HTML for basic
        functionality, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements. Any large ecommerce site, such as
        Amazon, that features numerous categories and pages and has both static and interactive elements is an example
        of a multi-page application</p>
    <h1>Differene Between Angular and React?</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
        AngularJS is a structural framework for developing dynamic web apps, whereas React is a JavaScript library that
        allows you to build UI components.
        Angular JS is based on MVC (Model View Controller) whereas React is based on Virtual DOM.
        Angular is based on Typescript and React is based on JavaScript.
        AngularJS doesn’t provide adding JavaScript library to the source code while React allows adding JavaScript
        library to the source code.</p>

    <h1>Library vs FrameWork?</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">However, there are technical differences between them. One core difference between a
        framework and a library is the use of queries. When using a library, the programmer decides when and where to
        call it.

        When using a framework, the framework dictates that. It provides the basic framework and tells the programmer
        what is needed. Accordingly, the necessary code is inserted by the developer and supplements the framework
        according to the desired function. In the end, however, it is the framework that calls up the code when it needs
        it and is also responsible for the running of the programme.</p>

    <h1>Virtual Dom Vs Real Dom?</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
        The Real DOM represents the web page often called a document with a logical tree and each branch of the tree
        ends in
        a node and each node contains object programmers can modify the content of the document using a scripting
        language like javascript and the changes and updates to the dom are fast because of its tree-like structure but
        after changes, the updated element and its children have to be re-rendered to update the application UI so the
        re-rendering of the UI which make the dom slow all the UI components you need to be rendered for every dom
        update so real dom would render the entire list and not only those item that receives the update

        VDOM is the virtual representation of Real DOM
        React update the state changes in Virtual DOM first and then it syncs with Real DOM
        Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do the changes in the blueprint but those changes will
        not directly apply to the machine.
        Virtual DOM is a programming concept where a virtual representation of a UI is kept in memory synced with “Real
        DOM ” by a library such as ReactDOM and this process is called reconciliation
        Virtual DOM makes the performance faster, not because the processing itself is done in less time. The reason is
        the amount of changed information – rather than wasting time on updating the entire page, you can dissect it
        into small elements and interactions

    <h1>Oneway Data Binding vs Two way?</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In one-way binding, the data flow is one-directional.
        This means that the flow of code is from typescript file to Html file.
        In order to achieve a one-way binding, we used the property binding concept in Angular.
        In property binding, we encapsulate the variable in Html with square brackets( [ ] ).
        We will understand this concept through an example in order to make it more comprehensible.
        In a two-way binding, the data flow is bi-directional.
        This means that the flow of code is from ts file to Html file as well as from Html file to ts file.
        In order to achieve a two-way binding, we will use ngModel or banana in a box syntax.
        To make sure the app doesn’t break, we need to import ‘FormsModule’ from ‘@angular/forms.
        Any changes to the view are propagated to the component class. Also, any changes to the properties in the
        component class are reflected in the view.
        To bind two properties in order to two-way binding works, declare the ngModel directive and set it equal to the
        name of the property.
        We will understand the concept through an example in order to make it more comprehensib
